# Resume

If you have access to a bounce FTP server, you can make it request files of other FTP server \(where you know some credentials\) and download that file to your own server.

## Requirements

- FTP valid credentials in the FTP Middle server  
- FTP valid credentials in Victim FTP server  
- Both server accepts the PORT command \(bounce FTP attack\)  
- You can write inside some directory of the FRP Middle server  
- The middle server will have more access inside the Victim FTP Server than you for some reason \(this is what you are going to exploit\) 

## Steps

1. Connect to your own FTP server and make the connection passive \(pasv command\) to make it listen in a directory where the victim service will send the file
2. Make the file that is going to send the FTP Middle server t the Victim server \(the exploit\). This file will be a plaint text of the needed commands to authenticate against the Victim server, change the directory and download a file to your own server.
3. Connect to the FTP Middle Server and upload de previous file
4. Make the FTP Middle server establish a connection with the victim server and send the exploit file
5. Capture the file in your own FTP server
6. Delete the exploit file from the FTP Middle server
